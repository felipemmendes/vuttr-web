# VUTTR Web

This is the code for the VUTTR Web.

This is a personal project.

## What is VUTTR?

Very Useful Tools To Remenber is a list app where you can save links and tools you don't wanna forget about.

## Features

- Users sessions;
- Tools management;
- Text and tags search;

## Getting Started

To run the React server you will need npm or yarn installed in your computer. Also, to test all features you will need to start the [VUTTR API](https://github.com/felipemmendes/vuttr-api) locally.

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/felipemmendes/vuttr-web.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

3. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and edit the variables with your own environment configuration (API url).

4. Start the server locally

   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```

   or

   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

6. `npm run build` or `yarn build` will create a `dist` folder, which contains the compiled version (the .js version) of the code.
